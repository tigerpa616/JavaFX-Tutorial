-The entire window of a gui is known as a stage-
    *That includes the minimize, fullscreen, and exit buttons*
-The content of the stage, so everything inside the window is known as a scene-
    *Inside the scene is where we will put all the cool stuff like buttons, widgets, and whatnot*
-A layout is basically how you want everything to appear-
-Whenever you want to have User Events you need to implement the Event Handler for it to work-
-Whenever an event occurs the handle method will be triggered, afterwards you need to find out the source of the event (what button was clicked for example)-
